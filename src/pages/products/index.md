        Cashsheet scans receipts, business cards and other documents and turns
        these scanned images into useful data that is categorized, organized,
        fully searchable and available anytime, anywhere.


        Any receipt submitted for processing goes through our data extraction process, where the important information (vendor, total, tax, date, payment type) is extracted and then verified by a team member to ensure the highest possible accuracy. The processed receipt data is then categorized, organized in your online account.

      text: Alfalfa is a legume hay in the pea family and is sometimes called
        “lucerne.” When properly cured, alfalfa is the best of the legume hays
        from a nutrient standpoint. Alfalfa is used for horses, dairy cows, beef
        cattle, sheep, chickens, turkeys and other farm animals, and has the
        most feed value of all the perennial pasture forages.
