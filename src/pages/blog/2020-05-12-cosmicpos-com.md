**A little history**

Our POS is designed to meet the needs of a variety of foodservice operations, including table service restaurants, fast casual restaurants, smaller hotel food & beverage operations, bars, pubs, delicatessens and cafeterias. This new touchscreen POS was designed specifically for the neighborhood independent restaurant. Our POS combines the reliability and value of the color touchscreen with a feature-rich embedded software application to provide restaurant operators an affordable, functional, “all-in-one” product from COSMIC.
