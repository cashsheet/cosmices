Cashsheet scans receipts, business cards and other documents and turns these scanned images into useful data that is categorized, organized, fully searchable and available anytime, anywhere.

Any receipt submitted for processing goes through our data extraction process, where the important information (vendor, total, tax, date, payment type) is extracted and then verified by a team member to ensure the highest possible accuracy. The processed receipt data is then categorized, organized in your online account.

Scanned receipts stored in Cashsheet are accepted by United States, and Canadian tax authorities. A lot of people don’t know that the IRS has been accepting digital receipts (that meet certain requirements) since 1997, now with Cashsheet this job has now become easy for you. Also accountants and bookkeepers love Cashsheet as you can give them display only access to your account and you will be all set for tax time.
