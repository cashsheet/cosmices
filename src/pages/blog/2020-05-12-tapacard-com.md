**What is SAP Transportation Management?** 

SAP TM is a Transportation Management System designed to manage planning, optimization, freight tendering, routing and charge management.  It supports different transportation modes like air, ocean, rail and road. This software is avilable for both Shippers and Logistics Service Providers.

**What SAP Systems Have Integration Capabilities With SAP Transportation Management?** 

SAP TM Currently connects to the following systems:

SAP ERP / ECC

SAP Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM)

SAP Event Management (EM)

SAP Process Integration / Process Orchestration (PI / PO)

**Does SAP Transportation Management come bundled with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) capabilities?** 

SAP TM does not have extensive GIS capabilities built in.  Typically, SAP TM is integrated with 3rd party GIS solutions for geo-coding, geo-routing (distance and duration determination) and visual map display.  SAP TM supports integration with all major GIS providers, including ALK's PC Miler, Rand McNally and HERE (formerly known as NAVTEQ). 

**What is SAP Event Management?** 

SAP Event Management (EM) can capture and expose detailed information around expected and actual events. It can be connected with SAP TM system.

**Does SAP Transportation Management support optimized routing and last mile planning?** 

SAP TM can handle multi-stop scenarios.  SAP TM comes bundled with route optimizer that utilizes a large number of configurable soft and hard constraints.  The use of the optimizer enables automated building of cost-effective freight orders, taking into consideration such parameters as accurate transit distance and duration, operating hours, loading and unloading durations, duty and drive time scheduling constraints, as well as many others.  Optimizer can be used in a fully automated manner, where freight orders are created periodically via a background job, or in an interactive manner where a transportation planner is presented with a proposed optimized solution and can then make adjustments to freight orders prior to saving.
